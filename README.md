This repository contains the final report and code of numerical experiments of the course Mathematical Introduction to Machine Learning at PKU. The work is done by Xiaoxuan Yu (numerical experiments), Yihang Xia (main parts of the report) and Fabrice Sashinkumar (proof of main results) from Peking University. The numerical code is written in `Julia`, along with its package `DifferentialEquations.jl`, maintained by Xiaoxuan Yu.
